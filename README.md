# Area of Applicability of spatial prediction models
Case study material for the paper on mapping the area of applicability.
The case study described in the paper can be reproduced using the "CaseStudy.Rmd" in the src folder. "Concept_figures.R" creates the conceptual figures used in the paper. "CaseStudyScenarios.R" was used to compare the AOAI/AOA for different scenarios of response variable, sample size and random seed. The script was run on a HPC system. The results are stored in "data/". "CaseStudyScenarios_figures.R" can be used to analyse the result for these data and create the figures used in the paper.
